## About me
I am a beginner tester looking for her professional place on earth, full of enthusiasm and good energy. 

After several years of searching for this place, in the meantime raising children, I found myself at a new starting point and here I am 🎯😉

At work, I value honest cooperation and clear rules, I get involved in the tasks entrusted to me.

I recently completed the Quality Assurance Engineer course, where I gained knowledge about software testing, learned to analyze technical documentation, create test scenarios and prepare reports.

As part of the course, I completed a final project and obtained a certificate.💪
I am currently preparing for the ISTQB exam. ✍

I want to keep learning and move towards automation.
I am mainly interested in remote or hybrid work.
